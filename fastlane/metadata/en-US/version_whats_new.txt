We’d like to inform that because of the intense use of this app, and the excess of full bottles available, the developers took longer than expected to release this update.
But what matters is that the wait is over, and now you can play Sueca as you’re used to, with your own rules!
So no excuses anymore! Just invite your friends and #drinkItAll

In this version you can also see the description of each card, so you can remember what each one means, in case you’re not able to remember things anymore…

Now you can share this app with those friends that have iPhone 4, or 4S, 5, 5S, 6, Plus and so on…

Did you know? You can draw a card shaking your device! Just hold it strong, who knows…

Don’t forget: if you like playing sueca, and drinking with friends, rate this app! Tell us what you’d like to see in the next update!

Thanks, that’s all folks!
